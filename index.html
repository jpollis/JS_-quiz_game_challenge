        <h1>Coding Challenge: Let's build a fun quiz game in the console!</h1>
		<p>1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>question itself</li>
		  <li>the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.)</li>
		  <li>correct answer (I would use a number for this)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>2. Create a couple of questions using the constructor</p>
		<p>3. Store them all inside an array</p>
		<p>4. Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each question should have a number) (Hint: write a method for the Question objects for this task)</p>
		<p>5. Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer such as you displayed it on Task 4</p>
		<p>6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct ot nor (Hint: write another method for this)</p>
		<p>7. Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that)</p>
